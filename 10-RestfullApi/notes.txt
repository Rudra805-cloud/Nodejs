restfull api yaa rest api 
Rest full api and rest api when we send our respospone(text,image,html doc,json,anything) to client form server

client ->req----->server------>res->client

client =>browser,app,mac app,anything,

we send generaly two type of request 
1)html res->Server side rendering (means rendering occure on server) cause less speed directly render on server and sow on browser 
          ->But we send html res when we confirmed our client is browser

2)json res->client side rendering( when rendering done by client side by us  like in react handel api) so this cause less speed
          -> send req in json format and handel on frontend 
          
=>Always resepect http method 
Get ,put ,post,patch,delete
means assign work they have already

=>html res in express                    =>same express handel in res 
  res.send()                                 res.json()
  res.render()
