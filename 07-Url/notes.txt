# HTTPS Protocol Documentation

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol used for transferring data across the web. It uses encryption (typically SSL/TLS) to protect data in transit between clients and servers.

## Key Points

- **Security**: Encrypts data to prevent interception and eavesdropping
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the website through digital certificates
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures data hasn't been tampered with during transmission
- **Port**: Uses port 443 by default (HTTP uses port 80)
- **Certificate**: Requires an SSL/TLS certificate issued by a Certificate Authority

## Usage in Node.js

In Node.js, the `https` module is used to create secure servers and make secure requests to external APIs.

//www.youtube.com/ ==> domain (contain ip address of sever unique name to easy to remember and recall)

/watch => path
 => endpoint (specific resource or action on the server)
 => identifies which resource or page on the domain you're accessing
 => comes after the domain name in the URL structure

?v=Nt-AsZh5woE => query string (parameters passed to the server)
  - ? => marks the start of query parameters
  - v => parameter name (video id in this case)
  - = => separator between key and value
  - Nt-AsZh5woE => parameter value
